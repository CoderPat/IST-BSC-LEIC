# ASA
A repository for the ASA (synthesis and analysis of algorithm) college course.
Contains the source code and any additional files (such as reports, etc..) for all the projects.

The original problem statements and reports are in portuguese, since that's the language of the course, but there is a small description of the problem in english in each folder.
